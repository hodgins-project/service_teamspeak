# Hodgins: Teamspeak Service

A repository, providing an teamspeak service for Hodgins Server.

## Description

This repository provides an ansible-playbook which will:

- pull the image
- create service folder
- create a systemd service file
- start and enable the systemd service
- open up the firewall

## Requirements

A hodgins server or compatible deployment must be provided.

## Install

Clone the repository next to your existing Hodgins Server code.

```
git clone https://github.com/hodgins-project/service_teamspeak.git
```

Afterwards, you can install the service.

```
ansible-playbook -i <path-to-your-inventory> -k -K -u <hodgins-users> playbooks/service_teamspeak.yml
```

## Usage

The installation will respond to you with a running teamspeak service.
Now you can login. At the first boot/ start, you should get the logs for the admin key of your new server:

```
$ sudo podman logs service_teamspeak 
```

To interact with the container, you will have multiple options.

Via Systemd on your hodgins server (recommended), you can interact with the service
the same way you are interacting with other services on your system.

Get the status:

```
$ sudo systemctl status podman
```

Restart the service (and apply updated images):

```
$ sudo systemctl restart container_teamspeak
```

Services in Hodgins are running in containers. You can interact with the containers
via Podman.

Check all containers:

```
podman ps
```

Restart a running container:

```
podman container restart teamspeak
```
